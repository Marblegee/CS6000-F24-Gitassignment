\section{Git Repository Related to My Research}
I cloned and tested a Git repository focused on detecting security vulnerabilities in 5G networks. The model was tested using a dataset of 10,000 samples, simulating various attacks on different network layers.

\subsection{Simulation Results}
The output from the code is as follows:
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{wireshark_results_MITM.jpg} % Adjust the path based on where you saved the image
  \caption{Wireshark screenshot showing ARP poisoning indicating an MITM attack.}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
Attack detected: Layer 2 - MITM attack successful.
\end{verbatim}

The simulation successfully detected multiple vulnerabilities in the network's Layer 2. Further testing on real-world data will be required.

\section{Questions for me:}
What is the most valuable lesson you've picked from the CS6000 lecture so far? -- Samuel Olowofila

\subsection{Questions for Abdul}
1. Looking at your experiment of random image generation what vulnerabilities you believe your research experiment still has
2. What previous research has been done in this particular field
